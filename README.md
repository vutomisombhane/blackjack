HOW TO PLAY

Blackjack is played with a 52-card pack and these cards are to be shuffled by the computer. This is a one-on-one game where the human 
player plays against the computer. The human player has R900 initially in their bank account and has to choose the amount they want to 
bet with in order to play. To play, the  player has to click deal.  Each player is initially given a card. The human player can choose to 
either ‘hit’ or ‘stand’. If the player clicks on hit, a card is distributed to both players. The aim is to have a total that is higher 
than the computer’s total keeping in mind that your total cannot exceed 21. If it does exceed 21, you lose. If the player (human) is 
satisfied with their total, they can choose to stand and no further action is made. The player has to be aware of the fact that they 
cannot see the computer’s total unless they click on stand. Both players’ totals are displayed and if the human player wins, you earn 
double the amount the you bet with and if you lose, you lose the money you bet with. If you want to play again, the same procedure 
follows.
